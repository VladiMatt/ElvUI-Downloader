INSTALLATION

Extract the program (ElvUI Downloader.exe) somewhere you can easily access it. I personally keep it on my desktop.

=========================================

SET UP & USAGE

The first time you run the program (or if you've deleted the config file) the program will attempt to autodetect your WoW installation directory.
If the program cannot find your WoW installation it will ask you to input the directory yourself (You can find by going to Battle.net > WoW > Options > Show in Explorer)

After it has your WoW installation directory, it will ask you if you want it to download ElvUI for Retail, to which you answer by pressing (Y/N) on your keyboard. The program will then ask the same for Classic.

After first time setup, it will save a config file in %APPDATA%/Roaming/ElvUIDownloader with the information it has gathered. This info is stored locally on your machine and nowhere else. Nothing is uploaded anywhere, your super secret WoW installation directory is kept private. ;)

Once the config file has been saved, the program will download ElvUI for whichever versions of WoW you've instructed it to, as well as automatically install them to the relevant folders. Super simple and lightweight!

If the program detects the config file, it will wait 3 seconds before starting the download. Pressing SHIFT during this period will allow you to change where to install the addons and/or change which versions of WoW to download for.

=========================================

UNINSTALLATION

Run the program and hit SHIFT before it starts the download to enter configuration mode. Set both Retail and Classic to NOT download (just hit N both times when asked) and it will delete the configuration file so you can easily remove all trace of the program.
